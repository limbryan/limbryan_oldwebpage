My research lies at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. I investigate how learning algorihtms can make robots more intelligent, versatile and robust. I am currently working on both robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks at MIT. 

## Legged locomotion
MIT Biomimetics Lab under Prof. Sangbae Kim
This research aims to see how learning can be used to complement more stable optimal control and optimization methods used for locomotion.

## Tactile Manipulation
Manipulation and Mechanimsms Lab (MCUBE) under Prof. Alberto Rodriguez 
This research focuses on using tactile feedback for localization of objects for more intelligent manipulation of objects.
